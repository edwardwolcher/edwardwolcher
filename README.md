> Arts Technologist & Cultural Organizer.


## Summary

I am an arts technologist & cultural organizer with over a decade of leadership experience in project management, information technology, and digital media production. I collaborate with artists, cultural organizations, and activists to plan and implement projects that amplify their voice. My work combines expertise as a program director with innovative use of web and media technologies.

## Professional Experience

### Culture Industry | Creative Technology Practice — current

During quarantine my focus has been re-envisioning live events as virtual productions. I bring skills in modern web design and application development, video and audio production, and project management from over a decade in arts leadership. (Major clients have included Northwest Folklife, Pridefest, Capitol Hill Arts District, Mutual Aid Seattle).

### Town Hall Seattle — 2010-2020

In my decade at Town Hall Seattle I produced over 500 events, developed an industry-leading multimedia program, and held a leadership role at the organization as it undertook a 35 million dollar capital fundraising campaign and building renovation. As their Curator of Lectures (2017-2020) I was responsible for planning and delivering a program of civics, science, and arts & culture events at thirty venues in Seattle for over 100,000 people. I developed deep knowledge of the Northwest's civic and cultural sectors, and all aspects of literary and performing arts management.

From 2014-2017 I served as Town Hall's Curator of Community Programs with a focus on outreach and media production. From 2010-2014 I served as their Patron Services Manager where I managed a transition to a new CRM, launched their podcast and video programs, and oversaw their front-of-house staff.

### Independent Production & Consulting — 2007-2019

I organized and facilitated events, wrote copy, and developed multimedia products for clients working in the arts, social justice, and environmental activism. (Major clients included One America, Rainier Arts Center, JunctionHouse Commons, the Seattle Arts Commission, and the Sustainable Path Foundation)

### Theatre and Media Artist — Ongoing

I am a playwright, sound-designer, and performer who has collaborated with organizations including: the Satori Group, The Northwest Film Forum, ACT Theatre, On the Boards, Inscape Arts & The Seattle Art Museum. My work as an artist gives me broad perspective on all sides of creative projects from big-picture vision to the nitty-gritty of project organization and finance.
