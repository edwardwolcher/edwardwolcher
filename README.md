## Summary

I am a values-driven leader with over a decade of experience in project management, information technology, and digital media production. I collaborate with artists, cultural organizations, and activists to plan and implement technologies that amplify their voice. My work combines expertise as a program director with innovative use of web and media technologies.

## Professional Experience

I bring skills in modern web design and application development, video and audio production, and project management from over a decade in arts leadership.

As their Curator of Lectures (2017-2020) I was responsible for planning and delivering a program of civics, science, and arts & culture events at thirty venues in Seattle for over 100,000 people. I developed deep knowledge of the Northwest's civic and cultural sectors, and all aspects of literary and performing arts management.

### Independent Production & Consulting — 2007-2019

I organized and facilitated events, wrote copy, and developed multimedia products for clients working in the arts, social justice, and environmental activism.
